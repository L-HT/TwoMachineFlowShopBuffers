# TwoMachineFlowShopBuffers

Heuristic Algorithms for Optimizing Two-Machine Flow Shops with Buffers.

This is an R package where the algorithms are implemented in C++ and called using Rcpp.

## How to install

Make sure you already have the `devtools` package installed in R. Then you only have to call
```
devtools::install_github("L-HT/TwoMachineFlowShopBuffers")
```
to install this package.

An example on how to call some basic functions can be found in `example.R` located in the subdirectory `tests`.

The zip files contain the scripts used to perform the experiment and subsequent evaluation.
